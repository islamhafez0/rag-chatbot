description: >
  As an Odoo Frontend Developer at TaqaTechno, I work on building full-stack web solutions tailored to our business needs using the Odoo ERP system. 
  I develop custom modules and APIs with Python, and integrate them seamlessly into the frontend using OWL (Odoo Web Library), focusing on dynamic, server-rendered data and performance. 
  I turn Figma designs into pixel-perfect Odoo themes, build fully custom websites, and continuously find creative solutions to improve our development flow. 
  My role bridges the gap between frontend design and backend logic—ensuring everything fits naturally into the Odoo ecosystem while delivering a smooth user experience.
